## Plezaro (plz)

A tiny PL/0 compiler with various own additions. A lot of my additions are based on Oberon-O.

The code is for my learning purposes.

## Notes

- A lot is borrowed from Wirth's books. 
- Use the logger provided in `include/internal` for any debug comms to console.
- `CMakeLists.txt` has the `-DDEBUG` flag. Turn off for release builds.
- REMINDER: Will experiment with CPM in CMakeLists!
